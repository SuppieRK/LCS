LCS workflow:

Consists of two main stages:
1. Exploitation - using known set of rules during event processing
2. Exploration - altering known set of rules to explore new possibilities

Exploitation can be split onto several stages:
1. Environmental sensors acquire new data or events from environment
2. Rules for which the condition matches the input event are searched and extracted from current population
3. A new rule is created if no matches is found in existing population - also known as covering.
4. The chosen rules are ranked by their fitness values and the rules with the highest predicted outcome are used to trigger the action.

Exploration phase is triggered after taking an action and consists of:
5. Once the action is performed, the system rewards the rules for which the action has been executed. RL module assigns credits to executed rules.
6. Rewards are used to update the rule fitness, applying evolutionary constraints to the existing population.
7. The genetic algorithm updates the existing population of rules by using genetic operators, such as crossover and mutation.
